      [H4]Unfinished Business[h4]
The PC is working on a long-term project such as a complex computer program or a light freighter refit. It may be personal or commissioned work. While long breaks may be acceptable, the Obligation cannot be totally fulfilled until the unfinished business is complete and it weighs heavily on the PC's mind whenever the character chooses to postpone working on it for any reason.

Fulfilling the terms of the contract reduces the character's obligation while putting them off or incurring expenses for the sake of fulfilling the contract might increase it.</Description>

The character's reputation casts a long shadow. Perhaps the PC took a famous and difficult bounty, owns a recognizable and deadly ship, or has beaten another well-known hunter to the punch in the past. Whatever the case, it is hard for the character to move unnoticed throughout the galaxy. This makes covert operations more difficult, but also means that informants are more likely to spill what they know when the PC arrives.</Description>

Whatever the case, this breach of the rules of the code affects the character's personal and professional life in a very real way.

This character, however, is a confirmed adrenaline junkie and chooses bounties not by their challenge or price, but by how exciting or dangerous they are. Avoiding the Obligation—perhaps by being a responsible business operator and considering every job's cost-benefit analysis—results in an almost immediate case of excitement withdrawal. when inactive, the character is edgy, moody, easily distracted, and generally unpleasant to be around.

The character has a strong addiction he must keep feeding. Whether it's a physical addiction to stims, dust, or alcohol, or a mental addiction such as gambling, law-breaking, or priceless antiques, the character devotes a lot of time, energy, and resources to pursuing or obtaining the object of his addiction. Avoiding this Obligation has an almost immediate result - withdrawal. The exact nature depends on the addiction, but the character finds it increasingly difficult to concentrate on even mundane tasks, often reflected in the GM adding anywhere from [SE] to [SE][SE][SE] to skill checks.

Now he must feed the addiction or the results turn ugly indeed. The character cannot back down from a fight of any kind and often goes in search of conflict when things get too tame for his tastes. Should the character go an entire session without combat of some kind, the GM may add a penalty of [SE] to any skill checks in the next session (or until the character gets a chance to fight).

   Not all Smugglers are Charmers, and given the contacts a Smuggler makes in his line of work, it's easy for him to insult the wrong person, group, or even species. This doesn't always lead to Bounty, however, since not everyone can afford the credits required for an official bounty. In these cases, the Smuggler just lives with the knowledge that certain parties in the galaxy would make his life very difficult if given the chance.

Since the best way to reduce this Obligation is to successfully complete contracts, proving himself reliable again, the Smuggler might find himself having to take the least desirable jobs for a while. Once he's repaired his reputation, he will be able to pick and choose again.

Alternatively, it could involve a rampaging gundark breaking into the pastureland or a rival mining baron deciding to execute a hostile takeover of the PCs' land. The GM is free to make the narrative effects of the Obligation triggering minimally invasive if it would distract from an important ongoing plotline or an unexpected and major issue for the PCs to deal with immediately and personally.

Whether it's as simple as a betrayed confidence or broken promise or as serious as treason or mutiny, the betrayal eats away at the character and affects his everyday life. The target of the betrayal may seek answers, compensation, or simply revenge.

In order to keep the secret safe, the character must do what he is told, although the blackmailer is savvy enough to keep the demand simple enough to maintain the blackmail for as long as possible, generally demanding money or favors.

In the pursuit of a past contract, the character was careless. He accidentally destroyed the prized possession of some major underground figure or killed someone important to that person. Now the figure holds it over the character's head. Ambiguous threats and demands for repayment have become near-constants in this character's life, as the underground figure refuses to let him forget his responsibility. He has a financial blood price or other compensation he could pay, but it is astronomical. Until it is paid off, however, the guilt and fear are ever-present. If this Obligation is triggered, the character can suffer [SE] to some or all skill checks during the session (at the GM's discretion) due to this burden on his nerves.

     The Colonist has entered into a long-term contract with a corporation or government related to his work at a colony. In many cases, these contracts are how colonists pay for their passage to the new world - a form of indentured servitude. Colonists might be contracted to provide bookkeeping, labor, or any other number of services. Failure to live up to a contract can result in financial penalties, imprisonment, deportation, or earning a bounty.</Description>

To make matters worse, depending on who owns the debt, even fully paying it off might not get the character completely off the hook - if the character can get that money, he can surely get more.

    The Colonist did something shameful, often some social taboo that isn't quite illegal. The shame and sideways glances from peers have forced the Colonist to seek a new life where he can start over free of embarrassment. The isolation of some colonies and cultures makes for some strange taboos not observed by the rest of the galaxy. Thus the taboo can be something terrible, or something as benign as drinking from a public fountain or showing a bare but innocuous body part.</Description>

The Colonist is not allowed to set foot in the Core, or any Imperial-controlled worlds, but is desperate to remove the stain on his reputation. While possible, the smallest misstep can be disastrous, setting progress back months or even years.

He may even have those who support him in some way (thus explaining the resources he potentially attains due to the Obligation), further exhorting him to follow "the Way" they all revere.

Some people are able to let that go and move past it. When the dead are loved ones, however, some can't just move on. The need to get even is so strong it dominates the Colonist's thoughts and dreams, causing them to obsess about the moment of exacted vengeance. The Colonist gladly betrays, abandons, or hurts anyone if it brings him closer to settling the score.

This makes any jobs he takes on harder, if not impossible, to complete. This Obligation is only likely to apply in certain sectors, and the extent of its influence determines the size of the Obligation. The Smuggler's own behavior might have caused this, or another party may have maliciously spread information about him. If the latter, the Obligation could be reduced by tracking down the person responsible and stopping him. Of the former, the Smuggler may have to avoid the affected area long enough that the locals forget him, or he might significantly change his appearance or name to avoid recognition.

If this obligation triggers and the PC participates in a violent act, the GM may add [SE] to any skill checks he makes for the remainder of the session. (This may be avoided through good roleplaying on the player's part, such as having his character always try to talk his way out of a fight, and if he's forced to do battle, only use weapons that stun or incapacitate his opponents).

      [H4]The Price of a Name[h4]
The character claimed to be someone else, taking credit for his accomplishments in a past negotiation in the hopes of a higher payday. The wronged party, either the person impersonated or the hiring party, is now angry. This enemy might respond by chasing down the character, spreading news of the duplicity, or demanding restitution to his reputation or his credit account.

      [H4]Witness Protection[h4]
Some Colonists never would have chosen life in a distant backwater, but authorities have deemed it necessary to hide them in the witness protection program. The Colonist is being hunted by the Hutt Cartels, Black Sun, the Tenloss Syndicate, or some other galactic-scale criminal organization as a material witness. The Colonist was given a new identity and sent to an obscure planet to safely await trial, but the syndicate won't stop looking for him.
